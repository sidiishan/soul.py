# Roadmap 🗺️

Planned features and improvements for soul.py. PRs welcome!

## 🧬 soul-schema (NEW)

A standalone PyPI library for auto-generating semantic layers from any database — the "portable Unity Catalog."

| Status | Feature | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 🔜 | PyPI package | `pip install soul-schema` |
| 🔜 | Multi-database | Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, BigQuery, Snowflake |
| 🔜 | Auto-descriptions | LLM-powered from metadata |
| 🔜 | Learning loop | Corrections are remembered |
| 🔲 | dbt YAML export | schema.yml generation |
| 🔲 | Vanna export | DDL + docs + examples |
| 🔲 | JOIN inference | Learn relationships from usage |

**Why?** Teams without Unity Catalog need a way to build semantic metadata for Text-to-SQL. soul-schema uses soul.py's memory primitive to remember what columns mean and get smarter over time.

| ✅ | RAG + RLM routing | Auto query classification |
| 🔲 | Auto summarization | Compress old memories |
| 🔲 | Importance scoring | Prioritize key facts |
| 🔲 | Tiered memory | Hot/warm/cold storage |
| 🔲 | Export/import | Backup & restore |

## Integrations

| Status | Integration | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| ✅ | Anthropic Claude | Native support |
| ✅ | OpenAI | Native support |
| ✅ | Ollama | OpenAI-compatible API |
| ✅ | **Google Gemini** | gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-2.0-flash (v0.1.6) |
| 🔲 | LangChain | Memory backend |
| 🔲 | LlamaIndex | Integration |

## GCP / Google Cloud Support

| Status | Feature | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 🔜 | Gemini models | Full provider support |
| 🔜 | Vertex AI embeddings | text-embedding-004 |
| 🔲 | Cloud Storage backend | GCS for memory persistence |
| 🔲 | Cloud Run deployment | One-click deploy |
| 🔲 | Firebase integration | Real-time sync |

**Why GCP?** Many teams are GCP-native and want to stay within Google's ecosystem. Full Gemini support means soul.py works without any OpenAI/Anthropic dependencies.
